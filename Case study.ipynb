    "**I travel and keep changing places very frequently. This is very hectic and plus I get to experience very different types of environment, of which i donot have much knowledge about. In such situation, food can be an important factor for decided how you rate your trips and plus also recommmending it to the people. Food can also attract people around to world to try it out if it were to be the best. In such scenarios, we need to find the right place, at reasonable cost, to serve us the best possible way. So there are few questions that must be addresed, such as :**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.How many types of foods are available in the restaurant ?\n",
    "2.which is the most nearest to me with good rating ?\n",
    "3.How many \"similar\" restaurants are available near by me ?\n",
    "4.Do the \"similar\" restaurants cost more ? if so, what speciality do that have ?\n",
    "\n",
    "To address such question, XXYZ company's manager decides to allocate this project to me not just to find out solutions to the questions but also build a system that can help in recommending new places based on their rankings compared to the previously visited by me.\n",

People could simply decide to look for a similar restaurant all the time because they are addicted to a specific category of food. People who rarely use restaurants would prefer to have the most rated restaurants nearby them and all this could be easily handed by our recommender system. So target for this project is basically everyone who is exploring different places or similar places.**"

    "Logically, the more the population of a neighborhood, the more people will be interested to walk openly into a restaurant and less the population, less number of people frequently visit a restaurant. \n",

    "Income of a neighborhood is also very important factor as population was. Income is directly proportional to the rich status of a neighborhood. If people in a neighborhood earn more than an average income, then it is very much possible that they will spend more ,however that is not always true . Therefore,a restaurant assessment is proportional to the income of a neighborhood."

Initially I scrapped list of neighbor's using beautifulSoup4 from wikipedia. The table headings becoming the boroughs and data becoming the neighborhoods. Gurgaon has 8 boroghs and 64 neighborhoods. So I manually googled each neighborhood to find its corresponding latitude and longitude. After doing so, I produced the following dataframe.**"
